M-TAMBO MAINTENANCE TRACKING AND DOCUMENTATION SOFTWARE
NB: Mtambo is a kiswahili word that refers to a mechanical system

Background
With the rapid growth of high-rise developments across Africa, the need for efficient management of critical building systems like HVAC, elevators, and power backup is increasing. Developers and maintenance companies require a simple CMMS to track and maintain these systems effectively. A tailored CMMS would help streamline maintenance operations.

Targeted users:
The CMMS will basically have 3 user groups:

Developers/Building owners
These the building owners, they can either be individual owners who own just own one building or large development companies who own multiple buildings.
The system will help this group of users to do the following:
Track all the 3 systems in all their facilities(buildings)
Monitor all the maintenance companies associated with the 3 systems
Real time tracking of the maintenance schedule of all systems in all their facilities
Be able to download the electronic maintenance log of any equipment as soon as its logged into the system by the relevant technician
Should be able to view the maintenance calendar of every single piece of equipment within any of his facilities
Should be able to view all the Maintenance companies associated with any of the 3 systems within any of his facilities.
Be able to automatically generate the maintenance history of any piece of equipment. 
 
Maintenance companies
In Kenya and across Africa, most of the maintenance companies for these 3 systems are small companies. With their core business being offering of maintenance operations, this CMMS will help this group of users to achieve the following:
Maintain an integrated calendar of all their maintenance jobs
Track all their technicians and their assigned jobs
View a list of all the buildings(facilities) where they have been contracted
Track all the maintenance jobs done by each of their technicians within a specified period
View a list of all their technicians
Generate and download the electronic maintenance logs for purposes of invoicing  
Technicians.
Technicians are the qualified individuals that every maintenance company uses to run their maintenance operations.
The CMMS should be able to help them to do the following:
Maintain a maintenance calendar on which buildings they should be attending to at any particular date
Generate electronic logs by just feeding the required data into the system
  

SYSTEM DESIGN

DASHBOARD
Given the requirements and the three distinct user groups, the system should have three primary dashboards, each tailored to the specific needs of the different users:
Developer/Building Owner Dashboard:
Track and monitor all systems (HVAC, elevators, power backup) across multiple facilities.
View maintenance schedules, history, and calendars.
Access and download electronic maintenance logs.
Monitor associated maintenance companies and technicians.
Maintenance Company Dashboard:
Manage and track all maintenance jobs and associated technicians.
View contracted buildings and their maintenance status.
Maintain an integrated maintenance calendar.
Generate and download electronic maintenance logs for invoicing.
Technician Dashboard:
Access personal maintenance calendar and job assignments.
Log maintenance activities into the system.
Generate electronic maintenance logs with relevant data entry.
These three dashboards will ensure that each user group can efficiently manage their specific tasks while maintaining an integrated approach to building system maintenance.

Indexing and Optimization
Indexes:
Create indexes on foreign keys to improve join performance (e.g., OwnerID, CompanyID, BuildingID, EquipmentID, TechnicianID, JobID).
Index commonly queried fields such as Email in the BuildingOwners, MaintenanceCompanies, and Technicians tables.
Normalization:
Ensure the database schema is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Use normalization techniques up to the third normal form (3NF) to organize data efficiently.
Security Considerations:
Store passwords using secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
Implement access control measures to ensure that users can only access and modify data they are authorized to handle.
